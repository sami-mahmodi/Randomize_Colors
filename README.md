Random Color Generator
This is a simple React app that generates random colors when you click on a button. The app is built using React and styled with CSS.

Getting Started
To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

Usage
To use the app, simply click on the "Generate Color" button. The app will generate a new random color, and the background color of the app will change to the new color. You can keep clicking the button to generate new colors.

Customization
If you want to customize the app, you can modify the CSS file (src/App.css). You can change the colors, fonts, and styles to match your preferences.

Contributing
If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. I welcome contributions of all types, including bug fixes, new features, and improvements to the code.
